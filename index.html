	<h2><u>Discover the pure culture of Basotho tribe </u></h2>

	<p1> As we go deeper from the high mountainous king dom , come and explore the eye catching nature of Lesotho and it's heritage.</p1> <br><br>

	<p2>My ambition with this website is to showcase  the beauty and culture of Lesotho. And I want to show how our traditional clothing, music, crafts, and festivals reflect the creativity and pride of our people. I hope to inspire others to learn about and appreciate our culture, so that the rich traditions of the Basotho are remembered and valued for generations to come. Through my work, I want to make sure that the story of our people continues to shine brightly.
